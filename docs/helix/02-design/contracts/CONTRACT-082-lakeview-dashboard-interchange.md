# CONTRACT-082: Lakeview dashboard interchange

**Profile:** `umf.lakeview` 0.1.0. **Native representation:** Databricks AI/BI
(Lakeview) `.lvdash.json` as observed in exported dashboards; no published Databricks
schema or workspace oracle is claimed. **Neutral projection:** `umf.dashboard` 0.1.0.

## Retention

Native JSON is held as the lossless tagged tree used by `umf.delta` (CONTRACT-018):
number tokens and member order are kept and nothing is parsed into host numbers. The
dashboard is split by identity rather than stored once:

| Scope | Kind | Native content |
|---|---|---|
| document | `dashboard` | top-level members except `datasets` and `pages`, plus `order`, the full top-level member order |
| module | `data` | none; holds dataset elements in source order |
| module | `page` | the page object except `layout`, plus `order` |
| element | `dataset` | one `datasets` item |
| element | `layout-item` | one page `layout` item (`widget` and `position`) |

Module ids are page `name`s; the data module is `data`, suffixed if a page already uses
that name. Element ids are dataset and widget `name`s, suffixed on a duplicate; missing
names fall back to their position. Module and element order are the native order.

`LAKEVIEW_SCOPE` and `LAKEVIEW_PLACEMENT` reject wrong attachment scope or container;
`LAKEVIEW_ROOT` rejects element payloads without a document-level dashboard;
`LAKEVIEW_NATIVE` rejects a non-object native root; `LAKEVIEW_ORDER` rejects an `order`
that is not exactly the retained members plus, where reassembled, `datasets`, `pages`
or `layout`. Unknown wrapper fields are `LAKEVIEW_REPRESENTATION` and block export.
Every document carries `LAKEVIEW_CONTEXT_UNVERIFIED`: widget specs are not checked
against Databricks, so interpretation is never complete.

## Export

`exportLakeviewDashboard` reassembles members in recorded order, datasets from the data
module and pages from page modules in module order, and renders compact JSON. The
result equals the source after the same compact rendering; whitespace and line endings
are not retained.

## Projection

Pages map `displayName` to title and `PAGE_TYPE_GLOBAL_FILTERS` to role
`global-filters`, otherwise `canvas`. Datasets become query sources in language
`databricks-sql` (`queryLines` joined, or `query`); `columns` entries with an expression
become `measure` fields keyed by `displayName`; plain columns are declared from the
projected widgets that use them. Field types are not inferred.

A widget query field expression resolves as: `` `c` `` → column `c`, aggregation
`none`; ``MEASURE(`m`)`` → measure `m`; `SUM`/`AVG`/`MIN`/`MAX`/`COUNT` of one column
→ that aggregation; `COUNT(DISTINCT `c`)` → `count-distinct`; any other aggregate over
one column → `custom` with the expression retained; a non-aggregate function of one
column → that column with `representation-change`. Qualified references, queries
without a `datasetName` (both read relationship-graph sources), multi-column
expressions and ``COUNT(`*`)``, which names no field the profile can declare, are
`unsupported` and the widget is not projected.

Widget types `counter`, `bar`, `line`, `area`, `scatter`, `pie`, `heatmap` and
`table` become visuals; `extra` becomes `tooltip`, table `columns` become `column`
encodings, and `y.fields` become repeated `y` encodings. `scale.sort.by` on one axis by
the other axis maps to value order, `natural-order` and `alphabetical` to label order,
`-reversed` descending, and `custom-order` with `orderedValues` to a custom sort.
Formats `number` and `number-plain`, `number-currency` and `number-percent` map to
number, currency and percent. `disaggregated: true` is `rows: detail`. A dataset no
projected item draws a field from is not projected, because the profile requires at
least one field. Text boxes (`multilineTextboxSpec`,
`textbox_spec`) become markdown text. `filter-single-select`, `filter-multi-select`,
`filter-date-range-picker`, `filter-text-entry` and `filter-range-slider` become
filters whose targets resolve each `queryName` to a dataset and plain column; a
single-value or multi-value default maps to `default.values`. Frame titles and
descriptions map directly; a shown frame is the neutral default.

Pages with `layoutVersion: GRID_V1` use twelve columns and pages without one use six.
The document grid is twelve if any page is `GRID_V1`; legacy pages are then doubled
horizontally (`LAKEVIEW_GRID`). Theme colors, font and visualization colors map to the
neutral theme; `fontSettings.base` supplies the font and font color only when the
top-level spelling is absent.

## Loss Report

`importLakeviewDashboard` returns `{document, issues}`. Each issue is
`{path, code, classification, detail, retainedInSource: true}` where `path` is a JSON
Pointer into the source file. Codes are `LAKEVIEW_WIDGET_TYPE`, `LAKEVIEW_EXPRESSION`,
`LAKEVIEW_QUERY_FILTER` (the neutral visual is broader than the native one),
`LAKEVIEW_ORDER_BY`, `LAKEVIEW_PARAMETER`, `LAKEVIEW_RELATIONSHIP`,
`LAKEVIEW_DATASET_CONTEXT`, `LAKEVIEW_FILTER_DEFAULT`, `LAKEVIEW_FILTER_ASSOCIATIVITY`,
`LAKEVIEW_FORMAT`, `LAKEVIEW_GRID`, `LAKEVIEW_STYLE`, `LAKEVIEW_FIELD_COLLISION`,
`LAKEVIEW_PROJECTION` (the item could not be built, or the profile rejected it, and it
is omitted) and
`LAKEVIEW_UNMAPPED` (native content no rule consumed). Every native member is either
consumed by a mapping rule or reported, so the report is complete with respect to the
source. The issues map to HELIX `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers in dashboard workflows.

## API

`lakeviewRegistry()` registers `umf.dashboard` and `umf.lakeview`;
`inspectLakeview(document)` validates both. `importLakeviewDashboard(text, {id, title?,
namespace?})`, `exportLakeviewDashboard(document)` and
`getLakeviewNative(document, module?, element?)`, which returns a copy of the rendered
native JSON for the document, a page or an element.

`exportNeutralToLakeview(document)` exports an edited neutral declaration (CONTRACT-083).
